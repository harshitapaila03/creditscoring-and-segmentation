# Credit Scoring and Segmentation

## Introduction

Credit scoring and segmentation are crucial for financial institutions to assess customer creditworthiness and develop personalized financial products. This project analyzes customer behavior by applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, specifically clustering, to segment customers based on their credit scores and financial attributes.

## Analysis Overview

This analysis leverages clustering techniques to group customers based on credit behavior. Various visualizations illustrate the distribution and characteristics of different customer segments, providing actionable insights for financial decision-making.

## Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Transformation
- Clean and preprocess customer data to ensure quality and consistency.
- Encode categorical variables such as education level and employment status.

### 2. Credit Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
- Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on credit score.
- Label segments as "Very Low," "Low," "Good," and "Excellent" credit categories.

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Credit Utilization Ratio Distribution**: Box plot showing credit utilization across customers.
- **Loan Amount Distribution**: Histogram of loan amounts to understand borrowing trends.
- **Segment Visualization**: Scatter plot to display customer segmentation results.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: A heatmap to identify relationships between financial attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:

- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Marital Status**: Single, Married, etc.
- **Education Level**: High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD, etc.
